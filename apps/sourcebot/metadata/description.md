## Sourcebot

[Sourcebot](https://sourcebot.dev) is a self-hosted tool that helps developers and agents understand your codebase.

### Features

**Ask Sourcebot**
Ask complex questions about your codebase in natural language. It uses Sourcebot's existing code search and navigation tools to allow reasoning models to search your code, follow code nav references, and provide an answer that's rich with inline citations and navigable code snippets.

**Code Search**
Search across all your repos and branches, no matter where they're hosted. Blazingly fast, and supports regular expressions, repo/language search filters, boolean logic, and more.

**Code Navigation**
IDE-level code navigation (goto definition and find references) across all your repos.

**Built-in File Explorer**
Explore every file across all of your repos. Modern UI with syntax highlighting, file tree, code navigation, etc.

**Works with any code host and LLM**
Connect your code, wherever it's hosted. Bring your own LLM API key for Agentic Search and MCP. All hosted securely on-prem.
